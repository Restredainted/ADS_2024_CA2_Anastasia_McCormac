cyclopean gates of the inner chamber.
He finished his calculations and saw the way through.
Trazyn picked up his empathic obliterator and strode into the corridor.
Eyeholes in the bas-reliefs coughed, sending clouds of bone darts
clattering off his necrodermis. Trazyn snatched one out of the air and
analysed the tip: an exotic poison derived from a local marine
invertebrate, unique to this world.
He slipped it into a dimensional pocket and continued forward, sensing a
stone shift and sink beneath him.
A piece of masonry, hammer-shaped and weighing six tons, swept down
